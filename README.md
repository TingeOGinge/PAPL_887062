## Coursework Specification

### Introduction

This coursework assignment is designed to give you an opportunity to conceptualise and design, using a decision map/logic, a working mobile application. The focus of this coursework is on a functioning user interface.  The underlying functional architecture should remain as lightweight as possible as it is not central to grading for this coursework.  The assignment carries 25% of the unit marks. It assesses the learning outcome: Construct interactive software applications with usable user interfaces. The following document will provide the task breakdown, grading criteria and an appendix to help you understand what is required.

### Tasks

1. Submit a design decision map/logic of appropriate complexity with clear entry and exit points which will organise the underlying dynamic of the mobile application behaviour. This must be agreed with a member of the teaching team.
2. Implement the decision map/logic in a lightweight event driven interactive mobile app.
  - **This is the task covered by this repository.**
3. Upload and demonstrate* the mobile app - including a discussion of architecture, design, evaluation  and approach. The decision map/logic (Task 1) and UI Design guidelines will support the demonstration process.
